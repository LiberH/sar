How to model exclusivity on NXT IO ports?

The AVR microprocessor could be modeled as a device.

  The Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL): An introduction
  > "A processor is an abstraction of hardware and associate software that is
     responsible for scheduling and executing threads."
  > "Device abstraction represent entities that interface with the external
     environment of an application system."

  LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Hardware Developer Kit
  > "The main tasks for the AVR controller are power management, creating PWM
     output signals for the three motors, and performing A/D conversion form
     the input ports."

Yet, modeling it as a processor is more consistent and easier to understand.
